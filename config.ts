      "The focus is on the architecture of thought. Over the last eight years, simple coding evolved into a rigorous discipline of synthetic engineering. The goal isn't just to build, but to model digital experiences that process intent with the same precision as a neural net.",
      "Specializing in ML-integrated interfaces and high-dimensional design systems, the output remains constant: ensuring every pixel is a deliberate weight in the final model. Engineering is the logic; Artistry is the synthesis."
